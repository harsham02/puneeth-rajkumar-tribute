<p>The sea of people, thronging that gave last respects to Puneeth Rajkumar, is testimony to his iconic status in the state.</p>
<p> Over the last two decades, Puneeth Rajkumar grew from being an actor to an icon, much like his father, Dr Rajkumar. Puneeth had leveraged the influence he had to endorse many causes, refusing to take any remuneration for them.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="sub">Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC)</h2>
<div class="para">
<p>Puneeth Rajkumar had also agreed to be the brand ambassador for the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) in 2019.</p>
<p>After his demise, many recalled how he had, true to his style, readily agreed to be the face of the state-run organisation and refused to take any money for the same.</p>
 <p>He had reportedly wanted to encourage people to use more public transportation. During his association with the organisation, he had </p>
 <p>actively endorsed several campaigns of the BMTC, including the Bus Priority Lane, Less Traffic Day and a campaign against harassment of women.</p>
 </div>

<h2 class="sub">Brand ambassador for the state-run Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) </h2>

<div class="para">
<p>Following in the footsteps of his late father Dr Rajkumar, Puneeth Rajkumar too donned the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) brand ambassador's cap without accepting any remuneration.</p>
<p>In the 10 years that Puneeth endorsed KMF products, there was no actual agreement between him and the Federation.</p>
 <p>AS Premnath, former KMF MD, told The New Indian Express that Dr Rajkumar was the brand ambassador in the 1990s. “That was his first and last endorsement for any product, and it was advertised in newspapers and on Doordarshan.</p> 
 <p>The legendary actor did not take money,” he added. After Dr Rajkumar died in 2006, KMF did not have an ambassador for a few years. “In 2011, I met Puneeth and asked him if he could endorse KMF. He readily accepted,” Premnath recalled.</p>
 <p> It was also an idea of then KMF chairman Somashekar Reddy. Asked about remuneration, Puneeth had said, “When my father endorsed your products without taking a paisa, how can I demand money?” The actor endorsed Nandini Goodlife tetra packs in the first year.</p>
 <p> “When we told him the advertisement will be shot at a government school in a remote village near Devarayanadurga, he obliged. We shot the advertisement for three days.He would reach the spot at 8.00 am and leave only at 6.00 pm.</p>
<p> I remember him as a very down-to-earth person. He would sit with the children and have lunch,” he recalled. “With just his endorsement, KMF products started seeing good sales. That was the power of Puneeth,” he said.</p>

<h2 class="sub">Right to Education (RTE)</h2>
<div class="para">
<p>Education was a cause that was close to Puneeth Rajkumar and over decades, he worked in many ways to help those in need with the same. According to reports, he used to consistently sponsor the fees of thousands of students every year, and used to also financially assist many Kannada-medium schools in the state. In 2013, when the state government was finding several seats vacant in the  Right to Education (RTE) quota, they roped in Puneeth and Radhika Pandit as brand ambassadors to spread awareness about the legislation through a series of newspaper and TV advertisements. As the brand ambassador for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, he often appealed to parents to send their children to school and worked towards reducing drop-out rates in schools. He also had agreed to be the brand ambassador for the Skill Development Board. Speaking to the  Times of India, Higher Education Minister CN Ashwatha Narayana said that Puneeth readily agreed to the proposal.
K. Saurabh, who secured 260th rank in the UPSC Exams of 2023 had revealed that Puneeth's 2010 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prithvi_(2010_film)">Prithvi</a>to be his inspiration to be a civil servant.</p>

 In a video by the Karnataka government, he was seen urging people to support the government in controlling the disease.</p>

<p> On 29 October 2021, Puneeth complained of uneasiness to his wife Ashwini, and died on his way to <br>
    a hospital in Bangalore at the age of 46. The reason for his death was declared to be heart attack.<br>
    He donated his eyes at the Narayana Nethralaya Eye Hospital in accordance with a pledge by his <br>
    father Rajkumar, that he along with all his family members will donate their eyes after death.<br>
    The donation of his eyes has given eyesight to four different people. His state funeral was attended<br>
     by the then Chief Minister of Karnataka, Basavaraj Bommai and other leaders.</p>

   <p> The Chief Minister appealed to the people to pay homage and respect to Puneeth by behaving <br>
     with self-restraint and not giving room for any untoward incidents due to emotional outbursts.<br>
    There was a wave of mourning in the entire state of Karnataka due to his death.<br>
     Section 144 was implemented in many areas to control the fans.</p>
    
   <p> Bangalore was on high alert after the death of Puneeth Rajkumar. Offices and shops in Bangalore were shut down on Friday, an unofficial bandh was declared and police were brought in to control swarming crowds of fans in anticipation of violence after Puneeth died. <br>
    India's biggest IT services firm, Tata Consultancy Services, sent its employees an advisory around 15:00 local time, asking them to go home early. Television channels showed crowds of fans swarming toward the hospital where he was being treated, and police were out in force trying to control them.</p>
     Several cinema halls across Bangalore closed for the day and stopped screening movies in the city. Several popular pubs across the city also closed down after news of Puneeth Rajkumar's death came in.</p>
    
   <p> Puneeth's remains were kept in state at Kanteerava Stadium. Many celebrities, including his close friends and co-actors from the Kannada, Tamil, and Telugu film industries arrived to pay their respects.<br>
     Till the afternoon, the state government had plans to go ahead with the cremation on Saturday evening. But owing to the swerving crowd, the Karnataka government announced on Saturday that the cremation would be held on Sunday morning and the timings would be decided later.<br>
      Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said that the decision was taken as large crowds were still waiting to pay their last respects to their favorite actor. "As per the wishes of people, the funeral will be held tomorrow (Sunday) allowing everyone to have a final viewing.<br>
       I appeal to fans to cooperate with the police. The police are here to help them. They are also Puneeth's fans," he explained.</p>
    
    <p>Controlling the crowd outside the stadium was very challenging for the police. No vehicle could move on Vitthal Mallya Road owing to the size of the crowd gathered outside the stadium.<br>
         Police had to divert vehicles via Kasturba Road. After noon, traffic police blocked the movement of vehicles near the Cubbon Park gate. Vehicles of film stars and even those of the police had a tough time navigating the crowd outside Kanteerava Stadium in central Bangalore. <br>
         From Friday evening, people were flocking to the stadium without any break.</p>
    
    <p>His body was kept for public view at Kanteerava Stadium for 2 days and was reportedly attended by more than 30 Lakh people and was <cite><q><b>one of the largest funeral gatherings in Indian history of funerals</cite></b></q>.
         He wasn't cremated, like in Hindu customs, but buried to make a mausoleum dedicated to him so that people can still pay their last respects. He was buried alongside his parents at Sree Kanteerava Studios in Bangalore.<br> 
    After the eye initiative of Puneeth Rajkumar, there was a sudden increase in the eye donations across Karnataka that gave a boost and awareness amongst the people of the State. The doctors of Narayana Nethralaya that runs Dr. Rajkumar's eye bank has mentioned that from the eye bank's inauguration, there was 76,000 eye pledges in total for 30 years.<br>
     After November 2021, there is a huge number of one lakh eye donations registered in the last 10 months alone.</p>
